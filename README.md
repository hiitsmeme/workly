# workly README

With Workly you can track the time you spend coding with next to no effort.

## Features

The extension will add a violet button to your editor title menu. Pressing that button will record your starting time, pressing it again will record the stopping time and ask you for a file path (.txt or .xlsx) and an optional log entry. If a valid file path is given, Workly will add the date, the starting, the stopping time and the log entry to the file.
